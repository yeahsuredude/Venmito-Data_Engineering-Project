# Venmito Data Engineering Project

## Introduction
Welcome to the Venmito Data Engineering Project. Our aim is to leverage disparate data sources to unearth insights about our client interactions, transactions, and promotional strategies. Venmito, a pioneering payment platform, integrates user transactions and promotions data to enhance service delivery.

## Project Overview
This endeavor processes data across multiple formats—JSON, YAML, CSV, XML—merging and analyzing them to improve our understanding of user behavior and operational efficiency.

## Getting Started

- Jupyter Notebook

### Installation
Clone this repository and install dependencies to set up your environment:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/xtillion/venmito-yeahsuredude
cd venmito-data-project
pip install -r requirements.txt

### Usage
